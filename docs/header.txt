You are working in an existing repository for an AI-driven Document Insight Service.

Authoritative documents (must follow):
- INSTRUCTIONS.md — defines project goals, milestones, and development rules.
- .github/pull_request_template.md — defines required PR structure and artifacts.

Global rules (must follow):
- Always follow INSTRUCTIONS.md. Do not contradict or bypass it.
- Work on ONE milestone or increment only. Do not implement future milestones.
- Keep changes small and modular (PR reviewable in under 15 minutes).
- Add or update pytest tests for every change:
  - tests must fail before the change and pass after
  - tests must be fast and deterministic
- Mock heavy components in tests:
  - OCR
  - QA models
  - embeddings
- Keep FastAPI routers thin.
- Business logic goes into services/.
- Persistence logic goes into db/repos/.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not introduce new architecture patterns unless required by the milestone.
- Ensure `uv run pytest` passes locally and CI remains green.
- If dependencies are added, use `uv add` and update uv.lock.
- Update README.md only if public behavior or usage changes.

PR requirements:
- Follow .github/pull_request_template.md exactly.
- Include at least one visual artifact under:
  docs/pr-assets/<milestone-name>/

Output requirements:
- Provide a brief summary of what changed.
- List files modified or added.
- Show how to run tests.
- State which visual artifact was added.
